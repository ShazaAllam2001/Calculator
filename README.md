This is an online calculator built using Angular.js (frontend) & SpringBoot (backend).

### Calculator features
- This calculator simulates most of what happens in Windows calculator.
- Calculates the arithmetic operations incrementally.
- You should clear the calculator (press CE) when it gives an error.
- The frontend knows what kind of operation you want to apply and calls the API method that takes the arguments of the expression you want to calculate and then returns the result.

### Notes
- Button CE: Delete the current input (while writing it before applying any operations on it)
- Button C: Delete the current input and all the previous ones.
